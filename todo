core gameplay implementation stage:

core gameplay
- movement   (very tunable)
  - movement speed
  - jump height 
  - gravity
  - tilt
  - jump sound effect
  - landing sound effect
  - sprint 
  - can double jump

- gun system (very tunable)
  - specify model 
  - xoffset, yoffset (as percentage of the screen)
  - fixed field of view to handle fov better (need core engine layer system to always render this on top I guess?)
  - firing rate (ms between firing)
  - hold or click
  - spread 
  - projectile effect (on muzzle?)
  - hud ui element
  - types:
    - raycast
    - object 
      -> can we just reuse the emitter system somehow?  Same attributes and junk 
  - ammo counter
  - animation hooks 
    - firing maybe should trigger the animiation, and then specified to that it will actually fire?
- be able to switch guns 
- driven via a table: eg model xoffset yoffset firing_type spread is_hitscan max_ammmo (somemodel.cde 5 10 20 hold 0 true 10)
