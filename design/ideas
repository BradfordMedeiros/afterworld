- health uses the time system thing, that drains, enemies give back
- recurring level that forces you to replay, change permutations when going back 
- stack based level design (go into another level from one, do stuff, pop back out)
	- death pops you back up


- streams:
	- flowing rivers you flow through

- falling off the edge of the level respawns you in the nightmare!


- overhead cloud castle worlds that you have a window of opportunity to go to-+
